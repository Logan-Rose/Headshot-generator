# Headshot Generator

After hearing about the numerous generative AI powered headshot apps, I was dissapointed to find most of them wanted my money, some one them asking updards of 60$! all to hit an api that costs pennies per call.. so I decided to make my own.

## The Idea

OpenAi's Dalle 2 has a well documented API, and the functionality to modify provided images. So I figured I would use some of the skills I learned from an Iimage processing class I took in university to identify a face in a given photo, crop it, and feet it to Dalle with a propt to make it into a headshot. A few lines of code lader and I have myself a working prototype.
